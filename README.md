# Framework-2.0
This is my Python script created to digitalise a decision making framework to facilitate the choice of faecal sludge treatment technologies in developing countries

This framework was coded using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. 
If you would like to use it, simply download Anaconda on your laptop. You will also want to download the following packages that are used during the analysis by entering this line in the command prompt: 
"pip install plotly dataframe_image customtkinter -U kaleido treelib"
Then, write 'jupyter notebook' in the command prompt and enter. This should redirect you to the jupyter notebook environment
Upload the file to your library. 
Once uploaded, open the file and press run at the top of the script, read the instructions and answer the prompts. 
The output at the end is the technology group that was found most suitable for the inputs you provided. 

Please contact me at emg119@ic.ac.uk if you have any questions on how to run this script or how this framework was developed!
